# Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
This project was done for my software security class. The idea was to implement a secure banking API.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
To a first approximation, nothing was done well in this project.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
The most chalenging thing about this class was the lack of support from the instructor.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
This app has one layer of security, a hashing function that checks the user's credentials, it does not work.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ran a maven dependency report before and after refactoring this project.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
This class introduced me to key generation useing the keygen tool built into java. At this time i have never sucesfully used it to generate a key and cert but gaining some fimilarity with the interface was good.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
Nothing. I would be ashamed if a potential employer ever saw this and I fully intend to delete it once I get credit for creating it.
